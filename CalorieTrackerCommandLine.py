## This program helps users track their daily calorie consumption and provides a basic calorie calculator
## for estimating maintenance, weight loss, or weight gain goals.
## Input: 'Food Item Database.csv', Output: Daily calorie consumption 
## and recommended calorie intake based on the userâ€™s weight and diet goals.
